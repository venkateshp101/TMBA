1. Slow or Unstable Internet Connection

YouTube uses adaptive bitrate streaming, meaning it lowers quality if internet speed drops even slightly.

If your Wi-Fi fluctuates, video will switch to low resolution (144p) to prevent buffering.

Example:
1080p streaming needs around 5–8 Mbps, while 144p needs less than 0.3 Mbps.

2. Network Congestion

If many devices are using the same Wi-Fi (e.g., family streaming, downloads in background), speed distribution may drop.

Peak time usage (evening traffic) can also cause low bandwidth.

3. YouTube Automatic Quality Mode

By default, YouTube sets Auto quality mode, which constantly checks connection speed.

If it detects instability, it quickly drops resolution.

4. Device or Browser Limitations

Older devices, low-RAM phones, or outdated browsers may drop quality to reduce processing load.

Low battery mode or overheating can also trigger lower video quality.

5. ISP (Internet Provider) Throttling

Some ISPs limit streaming bandwidth after a certain usage limit or due to network load.

Using VPN sometimes improves or worsens speed depending on server.

6. Wi-Fi Signal Issues

Weak signal from router → reduced speed → YouTube lowers quality.

Distance, walls, interference (microwave, other radio waves) reduce Wi-Fi strength.



Problem |                                           Solution

Slow or unstable internet               | Restart router, use 5GHz Wi-Fi, switch to mobile data
Auto quality switching |                  Set quality manually to 1080p or 1080p HDR
Too many devices                           | Disconnect unwanted devices
Browser/device issue                       | Clear cache, update browser, restart device
ISP throttling                                   | Try VPN or contact ISP
Weak Wi-Fi                                      | Move closer to router or use LAN cable
